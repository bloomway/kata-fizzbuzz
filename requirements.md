# Requirements

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.  
If the number is divisible by 3 or contains 3, print "Fizz"  
If the number is divisible by 5 or contains 5, print "Buzz".  
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz".

"division" has precedence over the "contains"

4  => 4
5  => BuzzBuzz (divisible by 5, contains 5)    
6  => Fizz (divisible by 3)  
7  => 7  
8  => 8  
9  => Fizz  
10 => Buzz  
13 => Fizz  
15 => FizzBuzzBuzz (divisible by 3 and divisible by 5, contains 5)  
21 => Fizz  
33 => FizzFizzFizz (divisible by 3, contains two 3)  
51 => FizzBuzz  
53 => BuzzFizz
